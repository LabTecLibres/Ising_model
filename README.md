# Ising model
Here are the codes of the ising model we are developing to study cell organization

## Codes
They are written in C++ <br>
Currently there are 4 versions which works independently:

*Ising_Model_V0.c*  --> Starting working version

*Ising_Model_V1.c*   --> Current version but JUST INCLUDE COUPLING term (J)

*ising_Model_V1_woGTK.c*   --> V1 but with out the simulation window. It just store an end point image of the simulation

*Ising_Model_V2.c*   --> Current version which includes the INTERNAL COUPLING termn (J) together the EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD term (h)
